# loops

# print first five numbers
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

# print first 100 numbers

# we are having loops in python to do the repeatative works
# in python programming threre are two types of loops: for loop, and while loop

# print number from 1 to 15 using for loop

for i in range(1,16):
    print(i)
    
# in this loop the value of i starts from  i = 1, i =2, i=3, i=4......i=15

What is a Whois domain lookup?

How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?

How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?

How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Nest Nepal’s “Unlimited” hosting offering is not for single or few hosting subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other hosting Subscribers.

Accounts with an excessive database size (i.e., more than 1 GB) negatively affect the performance of the server. Nest Nepal may request that the database size be reduced to ensure proper performance or may disable the Subscriber’s account, with or without notice. Hosting subscriber’s can create multiple databases however size of each database should not be more than 1 GB.
Unlimited File Transfer
Nest Nepal does not set any limits on the amount of visitor traffic a website can receive or on the amount of content a hosting subscriber can upload to his/her/its website in a given month, nor does Nest Nepal charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the hosting subscriber’s use of the Services complies with these Terms.

What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀

frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?

How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

What Actually is Domain Name?
On the Internet, a domain name is an identifier string that specifies a sphere of administrative power, authority, or control. Domain names are used in a variety of networking contexts as well as for application-specific naming and addressing.

No, Since SSL are standard on all plans, You do not need to purchase any kind of additional SSL Certificates However you can look after them if you'd like to Get a Premium SSL instead of Free one.

WHOIS Lookup by Nest Nepal
frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?


Why are some entries hidden in my Whois Domain lookup?


My information doesn't match the Whois results, how do I change my Whois information?


Can I register for new domains via Whois domain lookup?


How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Unlimited Hosting Policy
What “Unlimited” means
Unlimited Disk Space/Bandwidth/Website Plans. This means that we do not set a limit on the amount of bandwidth, websites or disk space you may use in the normal operation of a personal or small business website, provided it complies with this Agreement. However, in the event your service usage or content presents a risk to the stability, performance or uptime of our servers, data storage, networking or other infrastructure, you may be required to upgrade to a VPS, or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is utilizing.
What “Unlimited” DOES NOT mean
Nest Nepal employs complex mechanisms to protect its hosting Subscribers and systems from any kind of abuse. Nest Nepal’s “Unlimited” hosting offering is not for single or few hosting subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other hosting Subscribers. Nest Nepal’s service is offering shared hosting service, which means that multiple hosting Subscriber’s websites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. Nest Nepal’s service is designed to meet the typical needs of small and medium sized businesses across globe. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, or non-typical applications better suited to a VPS or a dedicated server. Nest Nepal will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary. However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, Nest Nepal does place automated safeguards to protect against any website growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until Nest Nepal can evaluate said sites resource needs.
Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive SQL Database

Accounts with an excessive database size (i.e., more than 1 GB) negatively affect the performance of the server. Nest Nepal may request that the database size be reduced to ensure proper performance or may disable the Subscriber’s account, with or without notice. Hosting subscriber’s can create multiple databases however size of each database should not be more than 1 GB.
Unlimited File Transfer
Nest Nepal does not set any limits on the amount of visitor traffic a website can receive or on the amount of content a hosting subscriber can upload to his/her/its website in a given month, nor does Nest Nepal charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the hosting subscriber’s use of the Services complies with these Terms. In most cases, a hosting subscriber’s website will be able to support as much traffic as the hosting subscriber can legitimately acquire. However, Nest Nepal reserves the right to limit processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory in cases where it is necessary to prevent negatively impacting other hosting subscribers.

WHOIS Lookup by Nest Nepal
frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?


Why are some entries hidden in my Whois Domain lookup?


My information doesn't match the Whois results, how do I change my Whois information?


Can I register for new domains via Whois domain lookup?


How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

WHOIS Lookup by Nest Nepal
frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?


Why are some entries hidden in my Whois Domain lookup?


My information doesn't match the Whois results, how do I change my Whois information?


Can I register for new domains via Whois domain lookup?


How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.

What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

WHOIS Lookup by Nest Nepal
frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?


Why are some entries hidden in my Whois Domain lookup?


My information doesn't match the Whois results, how do I change my Whois information?


Can I register for new domains via Whois domain lookup?


How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

What “Unlimited” means
Unlimited Disk Space/Bandwidth/Website Plans. This means that we do not set a limit on the amount of bandwidth, websites or disk space you may use in the normal operation of a personal or small business website, provided it complies with this Agreement. However, in the event your service usage or content presents a risk to the stability, performance or uptime of our servers, data storage, networking or other infrastructure, you may be required to upgrade to a VPS, or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is utilizing.
What “Unlimited” DOES NOT mean
Nest Nepal employs complex mechanisms to protect its hosting Subscribers and systems from any kind of abuse. Nest Nepal’s “Unlimited” hosting offering is not for single or few hosting subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other hosting Subscribers. Nest Nepal’s service is offering shared hosting service, which means that multiple hosting Subscriber’s websites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. Nest Nepal’s service is designed to meet the typical needs of small and medium sized businesses across globe. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, or non-typical applications better suited to a VPS or a dedicated server. Nest Nepal will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary. However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, Nest Nepal does place automated safeguards to protect against any website growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until Nest Nepal can evaluate said sites resource needs.
Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive SQL Database

Accounts with an excessive database size (i.e., more than 1 GB) negatively affect the performance of the server. Nest Nepal may request that the database size be reduced to ensure proper performance or may disable the Subscriber’s account, with or without notice. Hosting subscriber’s can create multiple databases however size of each database should not be more than 1 GB.
Unlimited File Transfer
Nest Nepal does not set any limits on the amount of visitor traffic a website can receive or on the amount of content a hosting subscriber can upload to his/her/its website in a given month, nor does Nest Nepal charge additional fees based on increased use of bandwidth, as long as the hosting subscriber’s use of the Services complies with these Terms. In most cases, a hosting subscriber’s website will be able to support as much traffic as the hosting subscriber can legitimately acquire. However, Nest Nepal reserves the right to limit processor time, bandwidth, processes, or memory in cases where it is necessary to prevent negatively impacting other hosting subscribers.

frequently asked questions FAQ:


What is a Whois domain lookup?


What does the Whois domain database contain?


What is a Whois IP lookup?


How do I conduct a Whois search?


How do I keep my Whois information updated?


What steps can I take to ensure my domain privacy is protected?

How do I find available domains through the Whois database?


What is WHOIS ?
As per ICANN regulations, when a domain is registered, registrants must provide registrars with up-to-date contact information. This information is displayed publicly in the Whois database, which acts like a giant address book that anyone can view.
Try our Whois domain tool now to find out if that domain you’ve had your eye on has already been taken. If it’s available, great! Register it today. If it’s already in use, why not make them an offer they can’t refuse?

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Which hosting plan is best for you?


Budget Option
Web (or Shared) Hosting is the most budget-friendly type of hosting. Since you're sharing resources — like neighbors in an apartment building — you spend less but have fewer options and less control.


More Power & Control
Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Business Hosting dedicate specific portions of a web server’s capacity and processing to each customer. Like a condo, your space (on the server) is yours.


Dedicated Resources
If you want the Resources to be only yours, We've got you Covered. The Resources are only yours. Whether its about the RAM assigned to you or CPU, Its yours along with the Flexibility of cPanel.
What makes Nest Nepal the #1 Choice for you?


Premium Support
Nest Nepal is always known for its Exceptional Support Experience. We've helped thousand Websites in Nepal to launch. 🚀


The Scalability & Flexibility
Whether you grow your visitors by 2 million in One Night. Scaling & Upgrading is 1-Click. Encounter any problems ? Our 24/7 Support team is Right here to assist.


99% SLA Guaranteed
We provide the Highest Uptime and Guarantee a Minimum Uptime of 99% p.m. If the SLA is even down by 0.01%, We refund you instantly. "Now Questions Asked"!


What is hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

Frequently Asked Questions


What is Shared Hosting?
A shared web hosting service is one in which several websites are hosted on a single web server that is linked to the Internet. Since the total cost of server servicing is distributed over multiple clients, this is usually the most cost-effective hosting choice.


What Payment Method do you accept ?
We accept almost every payment method available locally. Here are some major payment method listed: Credit/Debit cards, PayPal, Esewa, Khalti, IMEPay, Fonepay, Cellpay & Bank Transfer (Only for Nepal)


What Actually is Domain Name?
On the Internet, a domain name is an identifier string that specifies a sphere of administrative power, authority, or control. Domain names are used in a variety of networking contexts as well as for application-specific naming and addressing.


Do I need to purchase an Additional SSL Certificate for HTTPS ?
No, Since SSL are standard on all plans, You do not need to purchase any kind of additional SSL Certificates However you can look after them if you'd like to Get a Premium SSL instead of Free one.
